Three closely related proposals for adding (cyclic) adjunction to Minimalist grammars are given model-theoretic definitions and investigated with respect to their linguistic and formal properties. 
While they differ with respect to their linguistic adequacy, they behave largely the same on a computational level.
Weak generative capacity is not affected, and while subregular complexity varies betweeen the three proposals, it does not exceed the complexity imposed by Move.
The closure of Minimalist derivation tree languages under intersection with regular tree languages, however, is lost.
