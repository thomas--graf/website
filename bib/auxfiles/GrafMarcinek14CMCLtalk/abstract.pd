In response to Kobele et al. (2012), we evaluate four ways of linking the processing difficulty of sentences to the behavior of the top-down parser for Minimalist grammars developed in Stabler (2012).
We investigate the predictions these four metrics make for a number of relative clause constructions, and we conclude that at this point, none of them capture the full range of attested patterns.
