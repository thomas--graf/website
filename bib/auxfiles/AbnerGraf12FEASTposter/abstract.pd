We have argued in previous work based on data from English that Principle B is suspended in all those contexts that would allow for an unbounded number of pronouns to occur within a single binding domain.
American Sign Language seems to contradict this generalization.
We show that these are not true counterexamples as they involve discourse binding rather than syntactic binding.
This suggests a profound difference in the mechanisms that mediate binding in English and ASL.
