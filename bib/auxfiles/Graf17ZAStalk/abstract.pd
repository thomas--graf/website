Bobaljik & Sauerland's *\*ABA and the Combinatorics of Morphological Features* attempts to explain the absence of ABA patterns across languages in terms of feature combinatorics.
Their approach marks a step in the right direction by focusing on the algebra underlying the feature calculus, rather than the features themselves.
I argue, however, that one can go even further and adapt a strategy that talks directly about cells in a morphological paradigm. 
In support of this argument, I present results from my MOL paper [Graph Transductions and Typological Gaps in Morphological Paradigms](http://thomasgraf.net/graf17mol.html).
This approach has a lot in common with Bobaljik & Sauerland's, but the two also differ in some important respects.
Their respective insights may eventually be synthesized into a unified account.
