  title = {The English Noun Phrase in its Sentential Aspect},
  year = {1987},
  school = {MIT},
  abstract = {This dissertation is a defense of the hypothesis that the noun phrase
	is headed by a functional element (i.e., "non-lexical" category)
	D, identified with the determiner. In this way, the structure of
	the noun phrase parallels that of the sentence, which is headed by
	Infl(ection), under assumptions now standard within the Government-Binding
	(GB) framework. The central empirical problem addressed is the question
	of the proper analysis of the so-called "Poss-ing" gerund in English.
	This construction possesses simultaneously many properties of sentences,
	and many properties of noun phrases. The problem of capturing this
	dual aspect of the Poss-ing construction is heightened by current
	restrictive views of X-bar theory, which, in particular, rule out
	the obvious structure for Poss-ing, [NP NP VPing] , by virtue of
	its exocentricity. Consideration of languages in which nouns, even
	the most basic concrete nouns, show agreement (AGR) with their possessors,
	points to an analysis of the noun phrase as headed by an element
	similar to Infl, which provides a position for AGR; I call this Infl-like
	element "D". D and Infl belong to the class of non-lexical categories,
	which I prefer to call functional categories. The analysis in which
	D heads the noun phrase I call the "DP-analysis".Importing the DP-analysis
	into English yields an immediate solution for the problem of the
	Poss-ing gerund: Poss-ing gerunds (and by extension, noun phrases
	generally) have a more sentence-like structure than hitherto thought,
	namely, [DP DP's D VPing]. (In non-gerundive noun phrases, "VP" is
	replaced by a projection of N. This projection of N, despite being
	a maximal X-bar projection, corresponds to N-bar in the standard
	analysis.) Current trends in the treatment of minor categories --
	so-called "non-lexical" categories -- lead us to a similar conclusion.
	Until recently, minor categories like complementizers and modals
	had been treated as syncategorematic. Under current assumptions,
	however, they participate fully in the X-bar schema. In this way,
	two simplifications are achieved simultaneously: we eliminate syncategorematic
	elements. and we acquire an endocentric analysis of the sentence,
	which had been exceptional in being the only exocentric major category.
	To make these results fully general, we are led to treat the remaining
	syncategorematic elements -- in particular, determiners in noun phrases
	and degree words in adjective phrases -- as heads of full phrases.
	The analogy with complementizers and modals indicates that determiners
	and degree words should head nounphrases and adjective phrases, respectively.
	In other words, determiners are lexical instantiations of "D" in
	the same way that modals are lexical instantiations of Infl. However,
	despite the conceptual links, the question of the existence of a
	functional head of the noun phrase (the DP-analysis), and the question
	of the place of the determiner, are independent questions, and I
	treat them separately: Chapters One through Three are concerned predominately
	with the former question, Chapter Four with the latter. Chapter One
	provides a brief introduction. In Chapter Two I present the DP-analysis,
	motivating it by examining languages with agreement between noun
	and possessor. I also discuss issues raised by the DP-analysis, with
	emphasis on the parallelism between noun phrase and sentence hypothesized
	under the DP-analysis. In particular, I treat the question of PRO
	in the noun phrase; and I show that the numerous differences between
	sentence and noun phrase do not invalidate the parallelism of structure
	proposed under the DP-analysis. In Chapter Three I apply the analysis
	to the three gerundive constructions, Acc-ing, Poss-ing, and Ing-of.
	Finally, in Chapter Four, I turn to the question of whether the determiner
	is the lexical instantiation of D, the functional head of the noun
	phrase.}

	We implementthe base generation analysis using a minimal set of semantically

	arises because of the different way the features are bundled on functional

  pages = {373--415},
  abstract = {Pretheoretically,there are processes in languagesof the world that
	have both a syntactic component and a morphologicalcomponent. An
	example is the English passive, illustrated in (1):
	
	(1) a. The cats chase the mouse every day. b. The mouse is chased
	by the cats every day.
	
	(lb) differs from (la) in two ways. First, the NP that bears the patient
	or "logical object" semantic role appears as the surface direct object
	in (la) but as the surface subject in (lb). Second, the main verb
	in (lb) is morphologicallyderived from the (stem of the) verb in
	(la) by suffixing the -ed morpheme.Any complete account of the passive
	construction will have to encompass both of these aspects, the syntactic
	and the morphological. On this, all are agreed. How to integrate
	the two components into a unified account is another matter, however,
	and differing viewpoints abound regarding which component is primary
	and which is derived, at what level(s) of representation the two
	are explicitly related, and so on (for a cross section, see Chomsky
	(1981), Bresnan (1982c), Perlmutter and Postal (1977), Marantz(1981)).
	Part of the reason for this diversity is that the phenomenain and
	of themselves do not supply a wide enough range of evidence to guide
	theoretical decisions in this area. This article will shed new light
	on these issues by considering interactions of these processes in
	morphologically complex languages. In particular,it will argue that
	the morphology and the syntax in this class of cases must be two
	aspects of a single process. This result in turn will be shown to
	place strong, substantive constraints on the kind of syntactic framework
	that should be adopted.}

	the elimination of redundancy in the theory. Since movement characterizes
	a subset of the relations characterized by chains, the former is
	eliminated. Since the lexicon must constrain the input to the semantic
	component, intervening representations are eliminated, and the relationship
	between the lexicon and LF becomes direct. This timely approach explores

  abstract = {If we accept some results provided by some recent generative studies
	on Italian, it will appear that some purely syntactic processes affect
	the selection between the two aspectual auxiliariesof Italian: essere
	(be) and avere (have), as in (i) and (ii).
	
	 (i) a. Giovanni ha voluto venire Giovanni has wanted to come
	
	 b. Giovanni e' voluto venire Giovanni is (has) wanted to cume
	
	 (ii) a. Si vorrebbe gia aver comprato quei regali One would like

	 b. Quei regali si vorrebbero gia esser~ comprati Those presents one
	would like to already be (llave) bought
	
	In A Restructuring Rule in Italian Syntax, L. Rizzi has argued that
	in (i)b., but not in (i)a., a process altering the complementation
	relation between the two verbs has taken place, and that such a process
	is syntactic. Rizzi as well as other researchers have claimed that
	caseslike (ii)b. are derived from cases like (ii)a. via application
	of the syntactic rule of NP-movement. On the basis of this, one will
	be led to believe that syntactic factors playa role in the selection
	of the auxiliary in Italian. In this thesis we claim that not only
	is this belief correct, but that in fact the type of auxiliary reflects
	certain configurational properties of syntactic structure systematically.
	This view is supported by the fact that the distribution of auxiliaries
	is entirely uniform over some well-defined syntactic domains, such
	as: a. Passives, b. Reflexives (when the reflexive element is a clitic),
	c. Impersonals, since each of those constructions ti11 take essere
	invariably, and as in (iii).
	
	 (iii) a. Giovanni e' stato invitato Giovanni is (has) been invited
	
	 b. Giovanni si e' vestito Giovanni is (has) dressed himself
	
	 c. Si sarebbe invitato anche Giovanni One would be (have) invited
	Giovanni as well
	
	On the fact that among the apparently intransitive verbs, some normally
	select avere, while others select essere as in IIGiovanni ha telefonato/
	Giovanni has pholled" versus "Giovanni e r venuto/ Giovanni is (has)
	cornell, we assume, following some recent studies within Relational
	Grammar, in particular D. Perlmutter's Impersonal Passives and the
	Unaccusative Hypothesis, that the class of apparent intransitives
	is syntactically non-homogeneous, in that with verbs like venire
	the apparent subject is in fact a direct object at the level at which
	thematic relations, or the "argument structure" of predicates, are
	represented. The earlier part of the thesis is devoted to providing
	evidence for this bifurcation within apparently intransitive verbs.
	Beside providing an account for facts like those in (i), (ii), (iii)
	above, in the course of our discussion we will develop several subsystems
	of the grammar of Italian, test their interaction and examine some
	extensions to other languages. These subsystems are: The syntax of
	auxiliary assignment and past participle agreement. The syntax of
	"subject inversion". The syntax of "reduced relatives". The rule
	operative in causative and restructuring constructions. The syntax
	of reflexives.}

  abstract = {his vol in the Linguistic Inquiry Monograph Series contains a Preface
	& 13 Chpts. It explores certain issues related to the theories of
	government & bounding as elaborated in the "principles & parameters"
	model of Universal Grammar. The central idea is that the categories
	that act as barriers to government & those that act as barriers to
	movement can be treated in a unified way. (1) X-Bar Theory - outlines
	a theory of phrase structure based on the notion that both lexical
	& nonlexical categories project according to the same general schemata.
	Thus, INFL (I) & COMP (C) are no longer conceived of as defective
	categories. The maximal projection of C (C" or CP) corresponds to
	the traditional S', the maximal projection of I (I" or IP) to the
	traditional S. (2) Theory of Movement - sets forth the basic principles
	governing the rule Move a. Substitution & adjunction are distinguished.
	Substitution is restricted to minimal (ie, X(degrees)) & maximal
	(ie, X") projections, X(degrees) being allowed to move only to the
	head position & X" being allowed to move only to the specifier position.
	Adjunction is possible to a nonargument X" only. Several novel conceptions
	follow from these assumptions. Wh-movement, for example, becomes
	movement to the specifier position of C", as opposed to movement
	to COMP; maximal categories, moreover, are allowed to adjoin to VP.
	(3) Government - defines the notions of "c-command" & "government."
	Consideration of the special properties of adjunction structures
	leads to a definition of "government" in terms of exclusion rather
	than domination. (4) Barriers - explores the factors upon which the
	concept of barrier is contingent. It is suggested that maximal categories
	are never inherently barriers. They may become barriers, with respect
	to a given category g, either by being a "blocking category" (BC)
	for g or by immediately dominating a BC for g. A BC for a category
	g is, in essence, a maximal category dominating g that is a complement,
	ie, a th-marked sister of a lexical head. (5) Proper Government -
	examines the sort of data motivating the Empty Category Principle,
	in an effort to formally characterize the notion of proper government
	in the new framework. H. Lasnik's & M. Saito's (see LLBA 18/4, 8406650)
	proposal that antecedent government (chain coindexing) constitutes
	an instance of proper government is adopted & justified. It is argued
	further that a lexical head properly governs its complements. (6)
	Subjacency - considers how wh-movement must be assumed to function.
	The problem is that IP & VP are barriers (by definition) for the
	complements of V. Any direct movement of a verbal complement to the
	specifier position of CP therefore involves crossing two barriers.
	The assumption that phrases may adjoin to VP is shown to provide
	a means of denying barrierhood to both VP & IP. (7) Island Violations
	- shows how replacing the notion of bounding node with that of barrier
	yields a unified account of various island phenomena, including violations
	of the Subject Condition, the Adjunct Island Condition, the Complex
	Noun Phrase Constraint, & the Wh-Island Condition. (8) The Minimality
	Condition - argues for a condition blocking government of a complement
	by a more remote head when a closer head is available. Certain empirical
	consequences follow from such a condition. In particular, an explanation
	emerges for the fact that the subject of an NP may be wh-extracted
	in the Romance langs. (9) Vacuous Movement - advances the hypothesis
	that, whereas wh-movement must occur at the level of Logical Form,
	it need not occur at S-Structure. This hypothesis sheds light on
	several problematic phenomena of Eng & provides a simple means of
	handling the difference between Eng & langs like Chinese & Japanese
	that have wh-in-situ for simple interrogatives. (10) Parasitic Gaps
	- presents arguments for treating parasitic gaps as variables bound
	by an empty operator distinct from whatever operator binds the licensing
	gap. A chain composition algorithm links the chains of the two gaps.
	Alternative conditions aimed at explaining licensing gap asymmetries
	are considered. (11) A-Chains - addresses the issue of head movement,
	focusing on the process by which V moves to the head position I of
	IP, forming an inflected element & then moves to the head position
	of CP, as in the Eng Aux Inversion phenomenon. The discussion leads
	to the conclusion that head-to-head movement forms an A-chain. The
	chain coindexing condition that emerges appears to make it possible
	to reduce proper government to antecedent government. (12) Some Further
	Problems - considers possible solutions to various subsidiary problems,
	such as those posed by the impossibility of wh-extraction from predication
	structures, asymmetries regarding extraction from NPs, the structure
	of gerunds, & Exceptional Case-Marking configurations. (13) Summary
	- briefly reviews the proposed theory. Bibliog}

  abstract = {This paper proposes an architecture for the mapping between syntax
	& phonology - in particular, that aspect of phonology that determines
	the linear ordering of words. We propose that linearization is restricted
	in two key ways. (1) the relative ordering of words is fixed at the
	end of each phase, or "Spell-out domain"; & (2) ordering established
	in an earlier phase may not be revised or contradicted in a later
	phase. As a consequence, overt extraction out of a phase P may apply
	only if the result leaves unchanged the precedence relations established
	in P. We argue first that this architecture ("cyclic linearization")
	gives us a means of understanding the reasons for successive-cyclic
	movement. We then turn our attention to more specific predictions
	of the proposal: in particular, the effects of Holmberg's Generalization
	on Scandinavian Object Shift; & also the Inverse Holmberg Effects
	found in Scandinavian "Quantifier Movement" constructions (Rognvaldsson
	(1987); Jonsson (1996); Svenonius (2000)) & in Korean scrambling
	configurations (Ko (2003, 2004)). The cyclic linearization proposal
	makes predictions that cross-cut the details of particular syntactic
	configurations. For example, whether an apparent case of verb fronting
	results from V-to-C movement or from "remnant movement" of a VP whose
	complements have been removed by other processes, the verb should
	still be required to precede its complements after fronting if it
	preceded them before fronting according to an ordering established
	at an earlier phase. We argue that "cross-construction" consistency
	of this sort is in fact found. 68 References. Adapted from the source

	In the nominal system, the lack of CCs accounts for the fact that

	A Festschrift for Morris Halle, Anderson, S. & Kiparsky, P. [Eds],

	infinitival constructions in English & French is presented, & the

	Condition (SSC) is discussed with relation to French faire-infinitive
	constructions. The SSC is reformulated within an "index-rewriting"
	approach outlined here. Also discussed are faire ... par structures

  abstract = {Richard Kayne's (1994) linear correspondence axiom is reduced in the
	framework of Noam Chomsky's bare phrase structure by (1) converting
	the base step, which makes precedence conditional on command, to
	a theorem that follows from optimality, & (2) deducing the induction
	step of the axiom trivially from an assumption that permits dynamically
	split access to interpretation. It is proposed that spell-out applies
	only to a command unit formed by continuous application of Merge
	to a single object & that separate command units require multiple
	spell-out. Two versions of multiple spell-out are detailed - a conservative
	version in which phrase markers after spell-out cease to be phrasal,
	functioning instead like a lexical compound, & a radical version
	in which interphrasal association is accomplished in performative
	components. This system is claimed to be more dynamically derivational
	than that of Chomsky (1995) & to be conceptually indistinguishable
	from that of Chomsky's "Minimalist Inquiries: The Framework" (1998).

	the small clause (SC) theory in which "all subjects are structural
	subjects," & the predication theory, based on the idea of "subject
	as external argument." It is argued that a SC analysis of these constructions
	would require NP, VP to be defined as a structural subject in constructions
	such as Bill considers John sick. An added benefit of considering
	predication theory as an adequate analysis of these constructions
	is that it recognizes predicates & subjects. Subject is defined in
	terms of "predicate," allowing opacity to be defined in terms of
	predicates rather than subjects. 17 References. I. Mielonen}
